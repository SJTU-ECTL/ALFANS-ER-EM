# ALFANS-ER-EM
Source codes for two algorithms in the paper "[ALFANS: Multi-level Approximate Logic Synthesis Framework by Approximate Node Simplification](https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~wkqian/papers/Wu_Qian_ALFANS_Multi_level_Approximate_Logic_Synthesis_Framework_by_Approximate_Node_Simplification.pdf)" that involve both error rate and error magnitues constraints.

This project uses external packages CUDD and ABC.
After installing them, the paths in Makefile need to be modified according to your own directories.
